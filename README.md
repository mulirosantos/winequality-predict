# Machine Learn Project - Wine Quality Predict
> [Project Idea](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wine-quality-prediction-machine-learning/)

## Project desc:
Here we will predict the quality of wine on the basis of given features. We use the wine quality dataset available on Internet for free. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. By the use of several Machine learning models, we will predict the quality of the wine.

## Libraries:
* Pandas
* Scikit Learn
* Plotly

## Steps:
* **[STEP 01]** Import dataset 
* **[STEP 02]** Manually analysis dataset and prepare it for IA
* **[STEP 03]** Create a IA model to train
* **[STEP 04]** Check for the most accuracy model
* **[STEP 05]** Try to predict QUALITY from a new wine
